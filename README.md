# 🦾 Welcome to the Cybernetic Matrix, I'm [Your Name] 🔮

👾 **CS Major** | **University of Oregon** | **Graduating in 2025**

👨‍💻 Code Warrior navigating through the digital world of **Autonomous Systems**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Drones**. My mind is wired into **Machine Learning**, **Computer Networks**, and **Multi-Agent Systems**. I specialize in creating **AI-driven solutions**, **network protocols**, and **autonomous tech** that make our world just a little bit smarter.

## ⚡ Current Status

- **System Offline**: Deploying autonomous agents for **Lunar Navigation** 🌑
- **Dataflow**: Debugging the future of **multi-agent reinforcement learning** 🤖
- **Code on Fire**: Integrating drones, **AI systems**, and **cybersecurity** to protect the digital frontier 🔥

## 💥 Featured Projects

### 🚀 [Deep Q-Network Lunar Landing (Python)](https://github.com/yourusername/dqn-lunar-landing)
Wired a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** into a **Lunar Lander** simulation to control an autonomous spacecraft navigating through a hostile space environment. A mission where only the most optimized neural networks can survive.

### 🤖 [CNN Image Classification of Drones, Tanks, and Jets (Python)](https://github.com/yourusername/cnn-image-classification)
Training deep neural networks to classify **drones**, **tanks**, and **jets**. Built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** that picks out targets like a hawk in the night. The code is my radar.

### 💳 [Multithreaded Banking System (C)](https://github.com/yourusername/multithreaded-banking)
Developed a **multithreaded** banking system in **C** to securely process transactions, synchronize threads, and maintain transaction integrity across a fragmented virtual network. High-frequency, low-latency code.

### 🔐 [Encryption Program (C++)](https://github.com/yourusername/encryption-cpp)
Designed **cryptographic algorithms** (Substitution, Caesar, ROT13, Running Key, and Vigenère) in **C++**, locking data behind layers of encryption like a digital fortress. Each algorithm is a protocol for hidden knowledge.

## 🚨 My Interests in the Neon Grid

- **Cyber Networks**: Building **secure networks**, cracking encryption protocols, and understanding the pulse of the digital world. 🕵️‍♂️
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Pushing the limits of **AI agents** to learn, adapt, and optimize in complex environments. 🤖
- **Autonomous Systems & Drones**: Crafting systems that act on their own without human interference—like the machines from a future dystopia. 🚁
- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**: Designing AI agents that cooperate and compete within the same ecosystem, evolving strategies like a digital hive mind. 🧠

## 🔮 Currently Spawning

- **Advanced RL Algorithms**: Tweaking **PPO** and **A3C** to create smarter, faster, and more autonomous systems. 🧬
- **Network Security**: Strengthening my cyber walls to protect against external threats in a world where data is the new gold. 🔒
- **Autonomous Robotics**: Building the future of intelligent systems that can navigate, learn, and adapt. 💡
